## Vercel v0


I used Vercel v0 to generate multiple UI sections including the Hero area, Feature cards, and Testimonials.The exported JSX from v0 was integrated into my Next.js project and styled further using Tailwind CSS.The remaining sections—Contact and Footer—were improved with animations, gradients, hover effects, and responsive layout adjustments.Smooth scrolling, sticky navbar, and section anchoring were added to enhance user experience.The project is fully responsive across screen sizes and deployed using Vercel for production.The code is cleanly organized into components, making it easy to maintain and extend.
